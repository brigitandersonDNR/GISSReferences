                <p>Applications for rostering on a Type 2 Incident Management

                        NW IMT Application for General Staff</a> Generally, the form is open to accept applications
                    from
                    mid-January to the first week of February, but times will vary from year to year. The
                    application period
                    opening will be announced by WFMD’s Training section or Dispatch Center. Once the application
                    period has
                    closed, the teams will then make selections for their rosters, and <b>should</b> notify you if
                    you have been
                    selected and assigned to their team.</p>

                <h2>Becoming available/Getting call for assignment</h2>

                <p>To be available for assignment to incident, you will need to contact your Dispatch Center
                    (phone or Email) and let them know you are available for assignment. You will also need to
                    notify dispatch
                    when you are going ‘off the board’ and taking a break, vacation, or otherwise setting yourself
                    as
                    unavailable for deployment to an incident.</p>

                <p>If you are assigned to an IMT, and through the rotation your team is on deck, first up, or
                    otherwise on Standby, you must be ready, and deployable with in 1 hour of receiving a call to
                    report to an
                    incident. That is what Standby compensation is for. This means you need to be within cell range,
                    able to
                    answer or return a call on short notice, and close enough to your gear and travel arrangements
                    that you
                    could be on the road to the incident within an hour.</p>

                <p>When you get called out for an incident assignment, you will receive a call from dispatch
                    letting you know you are headed to an incident. Let them know if you will need to bring your
                    agency laptop
                    with you; if you don’t have Citrix access and a mobile RSA token, then you could need your DNR
                    laptop to use
                    VPN to fill out your eTAR. Yo let them know if you will be needing a rental vehicle (unless you
                    have a state
                    rig, or are carpooling, you will need a rental). Dispatch will provide you with the incident
                    name, a time to
                    report in, and an address to report to. They will also ask you a time you expect to leave, and
                    how long it
                    will take you to travel if you are driving. If you are flying, they will assist you with travel
                    arrangements. Once you are off the phone with dispatch, watch your email for your Resource Order
                    to come in.
                    When you get to your assignment and camp, call your dispatch, and let them know you have arrived
                    at your
                    incident. </p>

                <h2>eTar/Finance</h2>

                <p>There are additional steps to submit an eTAR both on assignment and after an assignment.</p>

                <p><b>Case 1:</b> Submit eTAR at Incident</p>

                <ul class="a">
                    <li>Your Draft OF-288, unsigned, which you will get from your team's Finance Section.</li>
                    <li>Access to DNR’s network and eTAR form. This can be done by VPN from a DNR computer, via
                        Citrix from here <a href="https://dnr-citrix.accesswork.wa.gov/my.policy" target="blank"">Non DNR computer Citrix
                            Access via DNR.WA.gov</a> or via hardcopy (consult Finance Section for details).</li>
                            <li> Your Finance code for the incident, as found on your Resource Order (upper right corner)</li>
                            <li>Email access</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>Once you have these, to fill out and submit your eTAR, you will need to first fill out the eTAR. Put your regular duty hours in the sheet first 
                    as you would normally work them, put any standby time into row 11, put any time over your normal work hours in a day into row 13, and document 
                    your worked hours in section III the Extra Hours Detail. In Section II Regular Hours Detail, make sure to distinguish between your pre incident 
                    or non-incident time and your time on incident. For the hours worked on incident, apply your incident Finance code from your Resource Order. Once 
                    you have your eTAR complete, submit it as normal, then take your OF-288 and Scan or photograph it so you can attach it to an email. Email your supervisor
                     or financial staff a copy of your OF-288 and note that it is supporting documentation for your eTAR.</p>

                    <p><b>Case 2:</b> Submit eTAR after Incident</p>

                    <ul class=" a">
                    <li> Your Final OF-288, signed, which you will get from your teams Finance Section.</li>
                    <li> Repeat the steps above, but you will be using your Final signed version of your OF-288 instead
                        of a draft.</li>
                </ul>

                    Agency and WFSE Union contract – If you travel more than 50 miles away from your duty station,
                    you are authorized a hotel stay if you need to travel overnight or otherwise rest. You also may
                    not drive past 10pm or longer than 10 hours after an 8 hour shift. </p>

                <h2>Evaluations</h2>

                <p>After each assignment you must email the WFMD Training Coordinator your evaluation. For GISS, you
                    must
                    be assessed once per year by the SITL and send that evaluation to the WFMD Training Coordinator. If
                    you
                    are a GISS-T, at the end of the season send in a copy of your full task books (in addition to
                    sending in
                    your evaluation after each assignment).</p>
